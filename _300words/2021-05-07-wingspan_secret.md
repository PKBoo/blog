## Wow you clicked Wingspan on the Wingspan review in the right spot congrats here's your review

I played a game that introduced thousands of people to looking at cards with points and "abilities" on them and playing them so that you get stuff. I remember my first play of this game and thought "wow this game is all about trying to draw as many cards as possible so that you have as many options as possible to mitigate the massive amount of luck". After playing it 5 more times I can say that this game is all about playing bird cards. It's about playing bird cards and not worrying about how good you are at the game. 

You might get tricked on the surface thinking that this game is about trying to score higher than your opponents, but actually it's a game about playing bird cards. It's a game where you try to get a high score with the cards you can get while ignoring what everyone else does. If you really cared to play a competitive version of this game, you'd have to pre-seed the entire game, with the same deck, with the same starting cards, and let everyone play against the solo game then compare scores at the end. If this sounds dumb, I will just say that this is exactly something you can do in the digital version of the game, and it is definitely the best way to play competitively; as a high score game with seeding. 

Otherwise, maybe try enjoying playing bird cards?
