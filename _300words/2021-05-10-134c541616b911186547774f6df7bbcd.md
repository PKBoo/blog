### Secret 300 word review of Counting to 100

My first play of The Mind was trraaaash. I had assumed it was some sort of amazing game because of positive-press-spiel-des-jahres-word-of-mouth-tom-vasel-etc, but nothing could have prepared me for the 10 agonizing god forsaken minutes that was this game. People literally started taking out their phones or just stopped caring about the game. The game being co-op didn't help anyone's investment in the game. I put that shit that game where it belonged which was in a bunch of sleeves and into bigger box because the original box can't fit 100+ sleeved cards and I don't know why pandasaurus does this and why do game publishers think this is even remotely--

*35*  
But then, I learned that this game is a real good game if you like counting in your head to a specific beat. Which I originally thought was not something that anyone would find fun, but   
*47*  
*48*  
I guess it's fun.  
*50*  
*51*  
It didn't come together until I played it with me and another guy named **January 2019**, and we got to 100 and read the rules for what happens. It says we start over with the lives we have, and play our cards facedown so that we don't know what cards other players played until we finished the round.  
*71*  
*72*  
*73*  
And then the magic happened. We realized that the first "win" was just the tutorial. The real game was actually just...counting in your head to a specific beat.  
*78*  
*79*  
Also if you think you're not allowed to count in your head don't talk to me please go roll some dice or play birds, I'm fucking here to count in my head to 160bpm quarter notes.  
*87*  
*88*  
*89*  
*90*  
Because otherwise, anything else you did to win the first time, wouldn't work when you played the cards facedown.  
*92*  
No signalling.  
*94*  
No body language.  
*96*  
No mistakes.  
*98*  
Nothing except counting 160bpm quarter notes.  
*100*  

*99*  

Fuck.
