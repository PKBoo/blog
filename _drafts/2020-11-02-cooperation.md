## Thoughts on Cooperation in Games

Ok so, basically I feel like everybody's got their opinion of what cooperative board games should be like. Opinions like "They're bad", and "It's not real cooperation unless you have the option of working together". These opinions are similar in that they're both wrong.

First, if you think co-op games are bad then you need to get off your high horse. Like literally everybody who I talked to who has this opinion says the exact same shit. "It's basically just a solo game but with multiple people". No. In solo games you don't get to talk to other people and talk about what they want to do. You don't have multiple brains that want to do multiple things. You can't simulate multiple people playing simultaneously with hidden information. You are a bad man who has a bad opinion for no other reason than you literally don't want to play a game with other people. I bet you hate watching movies with other people too. You're not playing a co-op game if you just tell someone what to do just so you win. That has more to do with you than the game, *fortunately*.

"It's not real cooperation unless you have the option of cooperating." Unfortunately I can't glean the precise meaning from this statement, but the spirit of it seems to be "Forcing Cooperation Bad" which is a perfect statement to make to try work your way backwards from that statement and come up with the perfect anecdotes prove it, but also it has nothing to do with what makes a good co-op game. It's a pretty good model for healty cooperation, but this applies to games that aren't co-op games or team games. Good cooperation in games does look a lot like people who purposely collude, and it does look a lot like people having fun, but it doesn't really say anything about what cooperative board games should be like, besides the fact that people should purposely collude and have fun. But I'll give it to Quinns, I think we can both agree that the working together should **feel** like an expression of the players, not a requirement of the game.

A long time ago I used to have a friend that said that co-op games sucked because the only way to juice out that cooperative spirit and really squeeze everyone's brain together is to prevent players from being able to do everything themselves, in both the game and in the meta game. They hated co-op games because, normally, the games they liked allowed them to build things in a way that gives them those huge dopamine hitting turns; but in (otherwise good) co-op games, the game would handcuff them to only partially build things, making them feel like they couldn't really do anything themselves.

And they were right. Good co-op games really have to beat into players heads that they have to work together, and it seems like designers figured out if it was impossible (or at least kinda hard) to do everything themselves, then players would naturally begin to join together to solve the puzzle. But the issue that my friend was having was that the game showed you all the fun things and options you *could* do but only let you do 1/N things "for balance". It sucked to know what you could do, what you had to do, but only do half of anything. They would rather a 3-legged-race over a relay race.

So the point of this blog post was to talk more about the best game right now Townsfolk Tussle and I haven't gotten around to it yet but let's just go over some things in this game.

1) Townsfolk Tussle is a "cooperative" game.
2) It is not Cuphead.
3) Cooperative is in quotation marks because in the rules of the game, there is a line that says that the tasks each player has are secret and cannot be revealed until they are completed.
4) There are secrets in this game.
5) Tasks give you money or temporary buffs. Money is extremely important.
6) There are some tasks that tell you to damage your teammates.
7) This is a cooperative game.

So players all have to win together, but they have the *option* of being rewarded for trying to prevent the team from winning. Sounds like the perfect co-op game right?

The fact that there are people that say this is a take-that game actually makes me mad. There is no reason why the the Feats of Mettle have to be secret. All it does is make some people feel awkward about trying to lose on purpose sometimes, or makes someone seem like a complete asshole laughing about the funny thing they did just to get 2 coins.
