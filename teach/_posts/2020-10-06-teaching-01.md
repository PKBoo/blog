## Thoughts on Teaching Games Part 1

Ok so basically the best way to teach a game is to have the person be able to imagine or think about exactly what they will be doing and thinking in the game. Period.

The method doesn't matter. What matters is making use of their previous knowledge and mental muscles to take shortcuts for them to be able to play the game in their head. If the only way for them to play the game in their head is to play the game, then that is the method to teach the game.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
